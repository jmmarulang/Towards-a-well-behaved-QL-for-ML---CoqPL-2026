Different such sets V in general determine different Gödel logics GV (sets of those formulas which evaluate to 1 in every interpretation into V). It is shown that GV is axiomatizable iff V is finite, V is uncountable with 0 isolated in V, or every neighborhood of 0 in V is uncountable. Complete axiomatizations for each of these cases are given. The r.e. prenex, negation-free, and existential fragments of all first-order Gödel logics are also characterized.}

abstract = {Extensive research on formal verification of machine learning systems indicates that learning from data alone often fails to capture underlying background knowledge, such as specifications implicitly available in the data. Various neural network verifiers have been developed to ensure that a machine-learnt model satisfies correctness and safety properties; however, they typically assume a trained network with fixed weights. A promising approach for creating machine learning models that inherently satisfy constraints after training is to encode background knowledge as explicit logical constraints that guide the learning process via so-called differentiable logics. In this paper, we experimentally compare and evaluate various logics from the literature, present our findings, and highlight open problems for future work. We evaluate differentiable logics with respect to their suitability in training, and use a neural network verifier to check their ability to establish formal guarantees. The complete source code for our experiments is available as an easy-to-use framework for training with differentiable logics at https://github.com/tflinkow/comparing-differentiable-logics.}

abstract = {Quantification is an important topic in fuzzy theory and its applications. An overview is presented for quantification in fuzzy theory. After a brief review of quantifiers in first-order logic, two approaches of generalizing quantifiers are given, the algebraic method and the substitution method. By distinguishing the fuzziness of predicates and quantifiers, various approaches to quantification in fuzzy logic can be organized. Quantifiers in first-order logic can be generalized in crisp sense, and these generalized quantifiers can also be applied to fuzzy sets. Moreover, quantifiers themselves can be fuzzy, i.e., they can only be represented by a fuzzy set. These different kinds of quantifications are identified. Quantifiers relate close to the concept of the cardinality of a fuzzy set, which is summarized before investigating fuzzy quantifications. Different to classical logic, various semantics of propositions in fuzzy logic fall into different frameworks which are known as the possibility distribution-based reasoning system and the many-valued fuzzy logics. Accordingly, numerical and possibilistic interpretation explored in literature are reviewed conforming to these two frameworks.}

abstract = {The logic of bunched implications (BI) is a substructural logic that forms the backbone of separation logic, the much studied logic for reasoning about heap-manipulating programs. Although the proof theory and metatheory of BI are mathematically involved, the formalization of important metatheoretical results is still incipient. In this paper we present a self-contained formalized, in the Coq proof assistant, proof of a central metatheoretical property of BI: cut elimination for its sequent calculus. The presented proof is semantic, in the sense that is obtained by interpreting sequents in a particular “universal” model. This results in a more modular and elegant proof than a standard Gentzen-style cut elimination argument, which can be subtle and error-prone in manual proofs for BI. In particular, our semantic approach avoids unnecessary inversions on proof derivations, or the uses of cut reductions and the multi-cut rule. Besides modular, our approach is also robust: we demonstrate how our method scales, with minor modifications, to (i) an extension of BI with an arbitrary set of simple structural rules, and (ii) an extension with an S4-like □ modality.},

    abstract = {Hypersequent calculi arise by generalizing standard sequent calculi to refer to whole contexts of sequents instead of single sequents. We present a number of results using hypersequents to obtain a Gentzen-style characterization for the family of Gödel logics. We first describe analytic calculi for propositional finite and infinite-valued Gödel logics. We then show that the framework of hypersequents allows one to move straightforwardly from the propositional level to first-order as well as propositional quantification. A certain type of modality, enhancing the expressive power of Gödel logic, is also considered.},
